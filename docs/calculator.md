#Calculator

The calculator is our contrived sample component. It carries out simple arithmetic on two inputted values. It is configurable by passing context into it.

##Example 1
Adding two numbers
<div id="{{example1.id}}">
</div>

##Example 2
Subtracting two numbers
<div id="{{example2.id}}">
</div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="./bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
